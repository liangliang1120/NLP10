Assignment 10
1.复习上课内容
2. 回答一下理论题目
1. What is independent assumption in Naive bayes ?
   假设各特征之间相互独立。由于P(AB)=P(A)P(B)，所以P(a1,a2...,an|vj)=P(a1|vj)P(a2|vj)..P(an|vj)
   这样预估每个特征的概率比较容易。
   
2. What is MAP(maximum a posterior) and ML(maximum likelihood) ?
   maximum a posterior最大后验,等于max P(D|h)*P(h)；
   maximum likelihood即为max P(D|h)；
   两者差别在于先验概率P(h)，如果先验概率一样，则两者相同。

3. What is support vector in SVM?
   决定决策边界的点可以用向量表示，叫做支持向量。
   
4. What is the intuition behind SVM ?
   SVM是一个分类算法， 通过找到一条线或者一个分类平面， 将数据分隔在平面两侧，使得间隔最大化，从而达到最优分类的目的。

5. Shortly describ what 'random' means in random forest ?


6. What cariterion does XGBoost use to find the best split point in a tree ?


3. Practial part
Problem description: In this part you are going to build a classifier to detect if a piece of news is published by the Xinhua news agency (新华社）.
Hints:
1. Firstly, you have to come up with a way to represent the news. (Vectorize the sentence, you can find different ways to do so online)
2. Secondly, pick a machine learning algorithm that you think is suitable for this task
Congratulations! You have completed all assignments in this week. The question below is optional. If you still have time, why don't try it out.
Option:
Try differnt machine learning algorithms with different combinations of parameters in the practical part, and compare their performances (Better use some visualization techiniques).
