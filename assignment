Assignment 10
1.复习上课内容
2. 回答一下理论题目
1. What is independent assumption in Naive bayes ?
2. What is MAP(maximum a posterior) and ML(maximum likelihood) ?
3. What is support vector in SVM?
4. What is the intuition behind SVM ?
5. Shortly describ what 'random' means in random forest ?
6. What cariterion does XGBoost use to find the best split point in a tree ?
3. Practial part
Problem description: In this part you are going to build a classifier to detect if a piece of news is published by the Xinhua news agency (新华社）.
Hints:
1. Firstly, you have to come up with a way to represent the news. (Vectorize the sentence, you can find different ways to do so online)
2. Secondly, pick a machine learning algorithm that you think is suitable for this task
Congratulations! You have completed all assignments in this week. The question below is optional. If you still have time, why don't try it out.
Option:
Try differnt machine learning algorithms with different combinations of parameters in the practical part, and compare their performances (Better use some visualization techiniques).
